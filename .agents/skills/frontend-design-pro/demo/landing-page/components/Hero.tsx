/**
 * Editorial 5:7 — the report takes the wider track.
 *
 * This is the reverse of the usual split and of the version before it, which
 * gave the headline seven columns because the type was the visual: a
 * high-contrast serif at 80px genuinely was the image on that page. In a single
 * grotesque the headline is no longer the picture, so the artifact gets the
 * room and the words get a tighter measure — which is also better for reading.
 *
 * ── On filling the viewport ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `min-h-[100dvh]` is back on this section, and it is the one thing here worth
 * watching. It has now failed in both directions, which is what settled it:
 *
 *   Centred, with short content. An earlier hero pushed the headline roughly
 *   40% down a 1080px viewport and left an empty field above it. Every gate
 *   passed. It looked like nothing had loaded.
 *
 *   Top-aligned, with short content. The first draft of THIS hero moved the
 *   slack to the bottom instead, which was not better — 350px of empty page
 *   under the proof bar, measured in the capture.
 *
 * Neither is fixed by choosing a side, because both are the same defect: the
 * content was too short for the box. So the content grew — the report went back
 * to full-width rows, which is worth ~150px — and the remaining slack is split
 * evenly by centring. At 1080 that leaves a little over 100px top and bottom,
 * which reads as margin rather than as a void.
 *
 * `items-center` on the section, not on the grid: the grid's own `items-start`
 * still governs how the two columns sit relative to each other.
 *
 * The banned static-viewport utility is not named in prose anywhere in this app,
 * deliberately. RES-03 is a regex over source, so a comment explaining the rule
 * reads as a violation of it — and Tailwind scans comments too, so writing the
 * class name here also emitted a real unused utility into the stylesheet. Both
 * were live in the first draft of this file.
