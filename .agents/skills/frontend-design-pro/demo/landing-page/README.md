# `demo/landing-page` — Bellwether

A light editorial landing page for **Bellwether**, a fictional tool that rehearses
a pending database schema change against a mirror of production traffic and
reports what it would lock before it reaches the primary. It is sample output:
the page the pack produces from the prompt recorded in
[`docs/DEMO_PROMPTS.md`](../../docs/DEMO_PROMPTS.md), built under the pack's own
rules, with nothing on it hand-waved.

Bellwether does not exist. The quotes on the page are invented, the operating
figures are demo content, and the page says so on itself.

## Why this page is light

The anti-slop wall bans three AI-design defaults **unless the brief asks for
them**. The version of this page before this one was the second of those three —
near-black with a single acid-green accent — and it was not breaking any rule,
because its brief asked for exactly that. It still looked like every generated
developer-tool page on the internet, which is the outcome the wall exists to
prevent.

So the rebuild started with the brief rather than the CSS. The new one declines
the exemption in as many words, and the palette that replaced it avoids all three
defaults on their own terms: a **cool** porcelain ground rather than a warm cream,
a deep cobalt accent at L=45% rather than an acid neon high in both lightness and
chroma, and no hairline column rules anywhere. Reasoning and every measured
contrast ratio are in [`tokens.css`](tokens.css).

**Taking a documented exemption is not the same as making a decision.** That is
the whole lesson of this demo, and it is the one thing here worth carrying into
another project.

## Run it

```bash
cd demo/landing-page
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

```bash
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit, strict, with noUncheckedIndexedAccess
npm run build          # server build — what `next start` and the harnesses need
npm start
```

The parent repo installs none of these dependencies. This app has its own
`package.json` and its own lockfile, and `demo/tsconfig.json` excludes it from
the stub-typed regime the other demos use, so it type-checks against real
vendor typings.

## Five things that will bite you

**The static export is opt-in, and must stay that way.**

```bash
NEXT_OUTPUT_EXPORT=1 npm run build     # static export in out/
```

`tools/screenshots/lib/next-server.mjs` starts every demo with `next start`, and
`next start` refuses to run at all against an exported build. An unconditional
export takes down `npm run screenshots` and `npm run demos:verify` together —
the only two checks in this repo that render anything. Everything else reads
source.

The other half of that problem is solved rather than avoided: an export drops
*dynamic* route handlers, so `/api/site/overview` would 404 and leave the page in
its error state permanently. The handler is `force-static`, so Next evaluates it
at build time and writes the response into the output. `next dev` still re-reads
`screenshot-fixture.json` per request — verified, not assumed — so editing the
fixture still shows up on reload.

**A deployed build serves from a sub-path, and `fetch` does not know that.**
Next rewrites its own asset URLs from `basePath` but not the URLs you hand to
`fetch`. `app/page.tsx` reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` for exactly this reason; a
root-anchored `/api/site/overview` would 404 under a sub-path deploy and render
as a convincing imitation of a broken endpoint. `next.config.ts` takes the
private `NEXT_BASE_PATH` — a client component can only read the public one.

**PostCSS names `@tailwindcss/postcss`, not `tailwindcss`.** The plugin moved out
of the main package in Tailwind v4; the v3 key fails the build outright. There is
no `autoprefixer` either — v4 prefixes through Lightning CSS.

**`tokens.css` is separate from `lib/tokens.ts`, and the split is load-bearing.**
`@theme` is a Tailwind compiler directive, not CSS. It has to live in a stylesheet
the build reads, or every utility built from it — `bg-surface-page`,
`text-ink-muted`, `ring-accent` — silently resolves to nothing, with no error
anywhere. `lib/tokens.ts` carries only plain CSS that is valid at runtime, and
reads the palette back as `var(--color-*)` rather than restating it.

Lifting the palette into another project means taking `tokens.css` and importing
it **after** Tailwind. Import order in `app/globals.css` is deliberate and
commented.

**Fraunces is imported as `full.css`, and that is not interchangeable with
`index.css`.** The display face is chosen for its axes — `opsz` left on automatic
so optical sizing tracks the rendered size, `SOFT` and `WONK` pinned to 0 so it
reads as an editorial serif rather than a novelty one. Only the "full" build
carries those axes; `index.css` ships weight alone, and the
`font-variation-settings` in `lib/tokens.ts` would silently do nothing. The
italic file is imported too, because the headline uses a real italic rather than
a sheared roman — a synthesised italic on a high-contrast serif at display size
is obvious, and invisible to every gate in this repo.

## Where the page's own rules come from

Every constraint the page holds itself to is one the pack enforces on its
examples, and the suite runs on this directory too:

```bash
python scripts/test_constraints.py --dir demo --recursive --project
node scripts/parser_constraints.js demo/landing-page/components/*.tsx
```

The visible ones: no equal-height card grid — the bento runs 3+3 over 3, then
2+4, then 6, so no two rows share a shape, and the metric strip sits on a
`2fr 1fr 1fr 1fr` track; OKLCH only, no hex; an editorial serif and a grotesque
rather than Inter; the dynamic viewport unit rather than the static one; ease-out
on every transition; `tabular-nums` on every figure; a real fetch with four real
states rather than a `setTimeout` skeleton; `forwardRef` on the one interactive
control that needs it rather than on every wrapper.

One of those checks caught a real violation during this rebuild, and it is worth
knowing about before you write a comment here: **RES-03 is a regex over source,
so naming a banned utility in prose reads as using it.** A comment in `Hero.tsx`
explaining why the static viewport height is banned contained the class name, and
failed the suite — and because Tailwind scans comments for class names too, it
had also emitted a real, unused `min-height: 100vh` rule into the stylesheet.

The figures come from [`screenshot-fixture.json`](screenshot-fixture.json), served
by the demo's own `/api/site/overview`, so the capture is deterministic and a
recapture only moves pixels when the UI actually changed.

**No figure on this page describes `frontend-design-pro`.** A version before this
one quoted the pack's own counts and two of them drifted — it rendered "Six of 53"
against a real count of 59, and a gate count that was one behind, on a screenshot
linked from the repo README. A page about a fictional product has nothing to keep
in step.

That does cost something. Gate 11 reads this directory for `<number> <noun>`
pairs, and the nouns it watches are ordinary vocabulary for a database tool — a
foreign-key *constraint* is the obvious thing this product would talk about, and
writing a count next to that word here would be read as a claim about the pack
and fail the build. The copy says "checks", "rules" and "relations" instead.
