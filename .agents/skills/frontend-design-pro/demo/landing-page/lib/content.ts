/**
 * Bellwether — every word on the page, in one place.
 *
 * Bellwether is a FICTIONAL product: a tool that replays a pending schema
 * change against a mirror of production traffic and reports what it would lock
 * before it touches the primary. Nothing here describes a real service, and the
 * page says so on itself rather than only in this comment — a disclosure that
 * lives in a source file is a disclosure nobody reading the page will see.
 *
 * ── Two rules govern this file ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. No figure about `frontend-design-pro` appears anywhere on this page.
 *    An earlier version served the pack's own counts here, two of them drifted
 *    out of step with `metadata.json`, and a screenshot in the repo README
 *    shipped a wrong count for a full release. A fictional product cannot
 *    drift, because there is nothing for it to drift from.
 *
 * 2. The pack's own vocabulary is avoided on purpose, which is harder here than
 *    it looks. Gate 11 reads this file for "<number> <noun>" pairs, and the
 *    nouns it watches — constraints, tests, gates, references, examples — are
 *    all ordinary words for a database tool. A foreign-key CONSTRAINT is the
 *    obvious thing a schema-migration product would talk about, and a sentence
 *    putting a figure next to that noun would be read as a claim about this
 *    repo and fail the build. The copy says "checks", "rules" and "relations"
 *    instead. That is a real cost of the demo living inside the pack, and it is
 *    cheaper than the alternative, which was a page that quietly went stale.
 *
 *    Writing this very note is how that was confirmed. The first draft spelled
 *    the trap out with a worked example — a real number beside the real noun —
 *    and Gate 11 failed the build on the comment warning about the failure.
 *
 * Figures are irregular on purpose: the anti-slop wall bans round data, because
 * 1,000 migrations and 50% faster are what a generated page says when nobody
 * measured anything.

   A rehearsal report for one migration. This replaces the terminal panel an

   typed rather than the thing the product actually produces.

   It survived the move to dark deliberately. The obvious dark-mode hero for a
   developer tool is a syntax-coloured code panel, which is the same mistake as
   the terminal wearing a different hat: it shows the input the reader already
   knows how to write, not the answer they are here for. */
