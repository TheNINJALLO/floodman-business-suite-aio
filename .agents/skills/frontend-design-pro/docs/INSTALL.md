# Install

## One line (fastest)

```bash
npx skills add Krishna-Modi12/frontend-design-pro
```

Detects every agent you have installed and wires the pack into each, symlinking
one copy rather than duplicating it, so a later `npx skills update` reaches all
of them at once. `--copy` trades that for independent copies.

**The pack installs as one skill, and that is required, not incidental.** The
root `SKILL.md` router arrives with `core/` and all 19 `skills/` beside it; the
router does the routing. A root `SKILL.md` is what stops the installer walking
deeper, so the default behaviour is the correct one.

`--full-depth` overrides that and installs all twenty as peers. Do not pass it.
Measured against this repo:

```bash
npx skills add Krishna-Modi12/frontend-design-pro --list               # one entry — the router
npx skills add Krishna-Modi12/frontend-design-pro --list --full-depth  # the router plus all 19 behind it, as peers
```

The second form replaces a 2,126-token registry with nineteen skills competing to
match each request — the architecture this pack exists to avoid. `--skill <name>`
has the same effect for the skills it names, and is only useful if you genuinely
want one skill and not the router.

The CLI sends anonymous install telemetry by default; `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` opts
out. The pack itself sends nothing — see *What this pack does on your machine* in
[`../README.md`](../README.md), which lists the commands that verify it.

## From the git tree

From the root of the project you want the agent to work on:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Krishna-Modi12/frontend-design-pro && bash frontend-design-pro/setup.sh
```

The clone directory name is load-bearing: every adapter references
`frontend-design-pro/SKILL.md` relative to your project root, so cloning under
that exact name is what makes the path the installer writes a path that exists.
`setup.sh` detects the agent and writes its native rules file; `--dry-run` shows
what it would write first, and nothing is overwritten without `--force`.

This gives you the tree on `main`, which CI checks on every push. The numbered
route below gives you the released `.skill`, which is built only after all 11
gates pass — the difference matters if you want the artifact that cannot exist
while anything is red.

## From the released archive

1. Download the latest `frontend-design-pro-v*.skill` from [Releases](https://github.com/Krishna-Modi12/frontend-design-pro/releases). A `.skill` file is a zip whose root folder is `frontend-design-pro/`.

2. Unzip it into your agent's skills directory:

   ```bash
   # Claude Code
   unzip frontend-design-pro-v*.skill -d ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

   ```powershell
   # Windows PowerShell
   Expand-Archive frontend-design-pro-v*.skill -DestinationPath "$HOME\.claude\skills\"
   ```

   Other hosts: **Claude.ai** — upload the unzipped contents as project knowledge. **Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Continue.dev and Aider** keep their rules in a file, so the pack ships that file already written — run `bash frontend-design-pro/setup.sh` from your project root and it detects the agent and writes the right one. See [`install/`](../install/) for the files themselves and a card per host.

3. Confirm the layout. `SKILL.md` must sit at the root of the skill folder, beside `core/` and `skills/`:

   ```
   ~/.claude/skills/frontend-design-pro/
   ├── SKILL.md        ← the registry; the only file always read
   ├── core/           ← 8 shared primitives
   ├── skills/         ← 19 skills + references + examples
   └── scripts/  evals/  rules/
   ```

   Paths inside `SKILL.md` are relative to that root, so no configuration is needed.

4. Start a new chat and ask for UI in plain language:

   > Create a landing page for a SaaS product

   There are no slash commands. The agent reads the registry, matches your wording against trigger keywords, and loads exactly one skill plus its declared dependencies (~6,014–7,927 tokens). See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

> **Optional — `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`:** if your host has a system-prompt field, paste it in. `SKILL.md` alone is sufficient (it carries the identity, behavioural preamble, anti-slop wall, routing table and failure handling), but the system prompt makes the loading protocol, the intake trigger, the per-pass core-file citations and the validation contract explicit. It is version-free and every path it cites is verified by Gate 6 on each build.

## Contributor setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krishna-Modi12/frontend-design-pro.git
cd frontend-design-pro
npm install          # typescript, vitest, testing-library, jest-axe
npm run gates        # every gate, no archive — must be green before you change anything
```

Requires **Python 3.11+** and **Node 20+**. The Python scripts use only the standard library.

## Verify the install

```bash
npm run gates                            # or: python scripts/build_release.py --dry-run
```

Expected tail:

```
DRY RUN — all gates passed. No archive built.  (~45s)
```

The run prints one line per gate. All of them must read `✓`; a single `✗` aborts the chain and no archive can be produced. One `⚠` line is informational and does not block: an uncommitted-changes notice, which appears whenever your tree is dirty.

Individual gates, when you want a faster loop:

```bash
npm run typecheck    # strict tsc over all 55 examples
npm run constraints  # 44 syntactic constraints
npm run evals        # 22 eval cases
npm run regression   # 16 parser-vs-regex divergence cases
npm test             # vitest — 45 test files, 232 tests, run by Gate 7
```

## Build an archive

```bash
npm run build        # gated archive → dist/frontend-design-pro-v<version>.skill
```

`build_release.py` is the only supported way to produce a `.skill`. It runs every gate, builds the zip, unzips it to a temp directory, re-runs the compile and parser gates **against the extracted copy**, and deletes the archive if that smoke test fails.
