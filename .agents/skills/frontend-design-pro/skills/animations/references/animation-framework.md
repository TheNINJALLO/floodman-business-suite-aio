## Library Decision Guide

Pick ONE library per animation context. Never mix on the same element.

| Scenario | Best Tool | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Component enter/exit (modal, toast, sheet) | **Framer Motion** | AnimatePresence, physics springs |
| Shared element morph (card → detail) | **Framer Motion** | layoutId — built for this |
| Drag, swipe, gesture interactions | **Framer Motion** | useDragControls, velocity detection |
| Micro-interactions (button, hover, toggle) | **Framer Motion** or **CSS** | Both work; CSS is zero-bundle |
| Simple hover/focus transitions | **CSS** | No JS, zero overhead, interruptible |
| Scroll-driven sequences (pinned sections) | **GSAP ScrollTrigger** | Unmatched scroll control |
| SVG path drawing / morphing | **GSAP DrawSVG / MorphSVG** | No rival |
| Complex staggered timelines | **GSAP** | Timeline API is best in class |
| Text splitting per-char/per-word | **GSAP SplitText** | Purpose-built |
| 3D / WebGL transitions | **Three.js** | See threejs-advanced.md |
| Page-level route transitions | **React View Transitions API** | Native, zero JS |

**Bundle cost awareness:**
- CSS: 0KB
- Framer Motion full: ~45KB gzip (use LazyMotion + domAnimation: ~27KB)
- GSAP core: ~24KB (plugins extra)
- React View Transitions: 0KB (browser native)

**Never mix Framer + GSAP on same element** — conflicting transform matrices break both.

## The Four Questions

Before animating ANYTHING, answer in order:

### 1. Should it animate?

| Frequency | Animate? | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| High (100+/day) | NEVER | Keyboard shortcuts, command palette, toggles, tab switches |
| Moderate (tens/day) | Reduced — shorten and simplify | Sidebar expand, filter apply, inline save, row select |
| Occasional | Standard timing | Modals, toasts, dropdowns, page transitions |
| Rare/first-time | Can be elaborate | Onboarding, empty state → content, celebration |

### 2. What's the purpose?

Valid reasons ONLY:
- **Spatial consistency** — element enters/exits from where it belongs
- **State indication** — showing something changed
- **Explanation** — helping user understand a layout shift
- **Immediate feedback** — confirming an action was received
- **Preventing jarring changes** — smoothing abrupt DOM updates

"Looks cool" alone is NOT a valid reason.

### 3. What easing?

| Motion type | Easing | Custom curve |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Entering viewport | ease-out | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` |
| Leaving viewport | ease-in | `cubic-bezier(0.55, 0, 1, 0.45)` |
| On-screen movement | ease-in-out | `cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)` |
| Drawer/sheet | custom organic | `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)` |
| Spring (drag/gesture) | spring physics | `{ type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20 }` |

**NEVER use `ease-in` for entering elements** — feels sluggish.
**NEVER use bare CSS `linear` or `ease`** — always custom curve.

### 4. How fast?

| Element | Duration | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Button press/active | 100–160ms | Immediate feedback |
| Tooltip show | 150–200ms | Skip delay on subsequent hovers |
| Dropdown open | 150–250ms | |
| Toast enter/exit | 200–400ms | Exit can be faster than enter |
| Modal enter | 200–500ms | |
| Page transition | 300–800ms | Max allowed |
| Skeleton → content | 200–300ms | Crossfade |

**Hard rule: UI animations MUST stay under 300ms** (except page transitions and modals).

## Key Patterns

### Never Scale From Zero
```css
/* BAD — unnatural */
transform: scale(0) → scale(1);

/* GOOD — subtle entrance */
transform: scale(0.95) → scale(1);
opacity: 0 → 1;
```

### Popover Origin Awareness
```css
/* Scale from trigger point, not center */
transform-origin: var(--radix-popover-content-transform-origin);
```

### Interruptible UI
Use CSS transitions (not keyframes) for interactive elements. Transitions can be retargeted mid-animation; keyframes restart from zero.

```css
/* GOOD — interruptible */
.element { transition: opacity 400ms ease, transform 400ms ease; }

/* BAD — restarts on re-trigger */
@keyframes fadeIn { from { opacity: 0 } to { opacity: 1 } }
```

For an element entering the DOM, `@starting-style` gives the entry a transition rather than a
keyframe, so it stays interruptible and needs no JS mount flag:

```css
.popover {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
}
@starting-style {
  .popover { opacity: 0; }
}
```

Pair it with `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` when animating out of `display: none`.
Unsupported browsers skip the starting state and the element simply appears — degrade, not break.

### Blur Crossfade Bridge
```css
.element.transitioning {
  filter: blur(2px);
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

### Button Active State
```css
button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  transition: transform 160ms cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
}
```

### Toast Pattern (Sonner)
```css
@keyframes sonner-fade-in {
  0% { opacity: 0; transform: scale(0.8); }
  100% { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1); }
}
/* Swipe: 200ms ease-out */
/* Multiple transitions: transform 400ms, opacity 400ms, height 400ms */
```

### Drawer Pattern (Vaul)
```css
/* All drawer animations use this custom curve */
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
animation-duration: 0.5s;

[data-vaul-drawer] {
  touch-action: none;
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); /* Hardware acceleration */
}
```

### Spring Configuration (Apple-style)
```js
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }
// Keep bounce subtle (0.1–0.3)
// Avoid bounce in most UI contexts
```

A **named spring scale** beats picking numbers per component. Motion UI (`motion.dev/ui`)
publishes one worth copying — five springs spanning the range rather than one reused at
different durations:

| Name | stiffness / damping | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `snap` | 1218 / 70 | Immediate feedback — toggles, checkboxes |
| `ui` | 305 / 33 | The default for most interface motion |
| `gentle` | 110 / 20 | Larger surfaces — sheets, drawers |
| `lively` | 622 / 17 | Playful accents; the low damping *is* the bounce |
| `ambient` | 43 / 13 | Slow background drift |

Pair it with a travel scale — hover `4px`, enter `24px`, section `48px` — and a stagger scale —
tight `0.04s`, base `0.08s`, relaxed `0.15s`. Systematising all three is what stops each
component inventing its own distance and delay.

### The canonical scroll reveal

The scale above went unapplied for long enough that this pack accumulated **seven**
different reveal configs — six y-offsets, three trigger mechanisms, three durations — while
four separate prose rules quoted four stagger intervals that no code sample used. This block
is the resolution. Copy it; do not re-derive it.

| Knob | Value | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | `{ once: true, margin: "-80px" }` | Fires before the element reaches the viewport edge, so content is already moving when the reader arrives. `once` never re-hides. |
| Travel | `y: 24` | The `enter` tier of the travel scale above. `48` for a whole section, `4` for hover. |
| Item stagger | `staggerChildren: 0.08` | The `base` tier. This is the number to quote in prose. |
| Word stagger | `staggerChildren: 0.04` | The `tight` tier — per **word**, not per item. Different granularity, different tier. |
| Item duration | `0.5` | The entrance band in `../../design-research/references/motion-easing-catalog.md`. |
| Section duration | `0.6` | The section band in the same table. |
| Curve | the **Entering viewport** row of § 3 | Named once, above. Restating the literal per file is how the pack ended up with two competing "defaults". |

```tsx
const ENTER = [0.23, 1, 0.32, 1] as const   // § 3 "Entering viewport" — the one source

const container = { hidden: {}, show: { transition: { staggerChildren: 0.08 } } }
const item = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 24 },
  show: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.5, ease: ENTER } },
}

<motion.ul
  variants={container}
  initial="hidden"
  whileInView="show"
  viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-80px" }}
>
```

Wrap it in `useReducedMotion()` the way every recipe in `animation-recipes.md` does — the
canonical config is the motion, not permission to skip the gate.

**Deviate only with a reason you can name**, and put the reason next to the number. "This
grid has 14 cards so the stagger drops to `0.04` to stay under the 800 ms cascade ceiling"
is a reason. Picking `0.09` because it looked right is how the seven happened.

## Performance Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Animate only `transform` and `opacity` | Animate `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` |
| CSS transitions for interruptible UI | Keyframes for rapid repeated interactions |
| `will-change: transform` on animated elements | `will-change` on everything |
| Test on real devices under load | Assume desktop = mobile performance |

---

## Accessibility

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

**Never write `* { animation: none }` as the global fallback.** `animation: none`
removes the animation, so `animationend` and `transitionend` never fire — any
component that gates unmount, cleanup or a state change on those events hangs
forever, for exactly the users who opted out of motion. A near-zero duration
removes the motion and still fires the event on the next frame.

- `prefers-reduced-motion`: reduce motion to opacity or nothing — not zero animation. Movement is the objection; a crossfade usually still reads as calm.
- Scoped overrides are the better tool: name the element and give it its resting state (`.reveal { opacity: 1; transform: none; }`), so nothing lands invisible.
- Touch devices: no hover-dependent animations
- Keyboard actions: NEVER animate command palette or keyboard shortcut results

---

## Asymmetric Enter/Exit

Enter and exit often need different durations. A toast might fade in at 300ms but out at 200ms. Test with fresh eyes — what feels right after coding often feels off after sleep.

**Rule:** Exit = 60–70% of enter duration. Enter commands attention; exit gets out of the way.

```
Enter 300ms → Exit 180–210ms
Enter 500ms → Exit 300–350ms
Enter 200ms → Exit 120–140ms
```

## Quick Implementation Reference

For full code, load the dedicated file. Here quick anchors:

**Framer Motion** — component animations ([framer] shortcode):
```tsx
// Enter/exit
<AnimatePresence><motion.div initial={{opacity:0,y:16}} animate={{opacity:1,y:0}} exit={{opacity:0,y:-8}} /></AnimatePresence>
// Spring: { type:'spring', stiffness:400, damping:30 }
// Shared morph: layoutId="card-1"
```

**GSAP ScrollTrigger** — scroll sequences ([gsap] shortcode):
```js
gsap.to(el, { y: -100, scrollTrigger: { trigger: el, start: 'top 80%', end: 'bottom 20%', scrub: true } })
```

**CSS transitions** — hover/focus states (no library):
```css
.btn { transition: transform 120ms cubic-bezier(0.23,1,0.32,1), box-shadow 120ms; }
.btn:hover { transform: translateY(-2px); }
.btn:active { transform: translateY(0) scale(0.98); }
```

**React View Transitions** — page/route transitions ([vt] shortcode):
```tsx
<ViewTransition enter="slide-up" exit="fade-out"><Page /></ViewTransition>
```
